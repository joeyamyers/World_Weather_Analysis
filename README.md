# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to improve upon the previously created PlanMyTrip app. In order to accomplish this, I firstly added a weather description for each city. Then, I gave the customer the choice to search for travel destinations based on their weather preferences in the form of an input statement. From the narrowed-down list of potential travel destinations, the customer will then choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map for the customer to visualize their travel preferences.
